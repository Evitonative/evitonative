### Hi there
I'm a student who works on small code projects on the side.
Mainly I create Plugins for the Game [SCP: Secret Laboratory](https://scpslgame.com/) using the Plugin Loader [EXILED](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED) and small Discord Bots. For these projects I premarily use C# and have started using Java Script.
