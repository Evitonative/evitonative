### Hi there
I'm a student who works on small code projects on the side.
Mainly I create Plugins for the Game [SCP: Secret Laboratory](https://scpslgame.com/) using the Plugin Loader [EXILED](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED) and small Discord Bots. For these projects I premarily use ![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-239120?style=for-the-badge&logo=c-sharp&logoColor=white) and have started using ![Java Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E).
